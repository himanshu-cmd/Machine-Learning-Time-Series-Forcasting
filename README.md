# Machine-Learning-Time-Series-Forcasting
WALMART stores sales forecasting. (Time-Series forecasting, SARIMAX, FBprophet using Python)
The objective is predicting store sales using historical markdown data. Provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains a number of departments, the ask is to, predict the department-wise sales for each store.
One may proceed this problem statement, by using conventional Time-series forecasting using SARIMAX or by using FBprophet (with proper data modelling); but here it is done by simple Linear-Regression approach.
Since the data contains other variables also, apart from timeframe & dependent variable; so application of Time-series forecasting is somewhat difficult.
This way, we may proceed saying that - implementation wise, Time-Series forecasting may be seen as an extension of Linear-Regression.
